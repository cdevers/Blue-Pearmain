# Design — Legacy library indexer (GH #162, target 1.4.0)

## Problem & motivation

A large fraction of BP's review queue is family photos sitting on the wrong (public-leaning) side. Investigation of `data/curator.db`:

- The "general queue" is the `candidate_public` state: **34,045 photos, 34,035 of them Flickr-only** (`uuid IS NULL`).
- Every Flickr-only one has `privacy_reason = "no people detected"` and **zero `apple_persons`**.
- Flickr upload dates cluster **2008–2017** — the iPhoto era.

**Root cause:** BP's privacy classifier (`analyzer/privacy.py`) detects family/people *entirely* from Apple Photos ML metadata (named persons, face counts, people labels). These photos exist only on Flickr and were never matched to a current Apple Photos entry, so they carry none of that metadata. `classify()` falls through every people-check to the final step → `candidate_public`. They are **not** auto-published (confirmation is still required), but the queue is polluted and a bulk "confirm all" would be dangerous.

The metadata to fix this exists in the old, now-migrated library mounted (via AFP today) at a path such as `…/Photos Library.photoslibrary`: a **Photos 4** library (`ZGENERICASSET`, `LibrarySchemaVersion 5002`, `DatabaseVersion 112`) containing **1,451 named people** including the whole family (Isaac, Aidan, May, Chris, Don Devers, …).

## Goal & boundary

Build the **foundation** ("index now, match later"):

1. Index the old library's per-asset metadata + copied thumbnails into new `legacy_*` tables in `curator.db`.
2. Expose a `bp` CLI command to build/refresh the index from a **runtime-supplied path**.
3. Provide a **non-destructive matching-preview** report identifying which legacy assets likely correspond to the Flickr-only `candidate_public` photos.

**Out of scope (deliberately deferred):**
- Reviewer UI browse page for legacy assets.
- Actual reclassification / merge of matched photos — that is the iPhoto migration (#12).
- Re-generating high-resolution thumbnails.
- Normalized person/face tables for the legacy data.

## Path independence (explicit constraint)

The library is mounted via AFP today but may move to SMB, a different IP, or an external HDD. Therefore:

- Asset identity is **`(library_uuid, asset_uuid)`** — the bundle's `databaseUuid` plus the asset's stable ZUUID. The **absolute mount path is never part of the identity** and is never persisted as such.
- `master_rel_path` is stored **relative to the library bundle root**.
- Thumbnails are **copied into BP's thumb cache**, keyed by a stable hash of the identity, so a transport/path change requires **no reindex**.
- The library root path is supplied at index time (`--library` flag, or optional config default).

## Optional local DB cache (performance & resilience)

Opening the library directly over AFP is slow: a verified open-test took **243 s (~4 min)** to load 237,309 photos. The library's `database/` directory is **6.5 GB** — small enough to cache locally (86 GB free).

- Optional `--cache-db` behaviour: before opening, mirror the library's `database/` plus the small bundle plists osxphotos needs (e.g. `DataModelVersion.plist`) into a local skeleton bundle at `<dir of curator.db>/legacy-cache/<library_uuid>/` (i.e. under `data/`, derived from the configured DB path), then point osxphotos at the local copy. `data/` is git-ignored, so this stays **out of the repo** while living alongside `curator.db`.
- Keyed by `library_uuid`, so multiple libraries and refreshes coexist; the cache is purely a performance/resilience aid, never part of asset identity, and is safe to delete and rebuild.
- Thumbnails are read from the live mount during the single index run (then copied into BP's thumb cache as the durable artifact), so the cache only needs the database files, not the originals/derivatives.

## Data model (new migration)

New table `legacy_assets` (one row per old-library asset):

| Column | Notes |
|---|---|
| `id` | INTEGER PK |
| `library_uuid` | TEXT — source bundle `databaseUuid` |
| `asset_uuid` | TEXT — asset stable ZUUID |
| `original_filename` | TEXT |
| `fingerprint` | TEXT — osxphotos fingerprint / cloud guid |
| `date_taken` | TEXT ISO8601 |
| `width`, `height` | INTEGER |
| `latitude`, `longitude` | REAL |
| `title`, `description` | TEXT |
| `keywords` | TEXT — JSON array |
| `labels` | TEXT — JSON array |
| `persons` | TEXT — JSON array of names (mirrors `photos.apple_persons`) |
| `named_face_count` | INTEGER |
| `unknown_face_count` | INTEGER |
| `master_rel_path` | TEXT — path relative to bundle root |
| `thumbnail_path` | TEXT — absolute path in BP thumb cache (copied) |
| `indexed_at` | TEXT ISO8601 |

Constraint: `UNIQUE(library_uuid, asset_uuid)`. Indexes on `date_taken` and `(width, height)` to support the matching preview.

**Design choice:** mirror the existing `photos.apple_persons` JSON-array convention rather than introducing normalized `legacy_persons` / join tables. Consistent with the codebase; YAGNI for this phase.

Migration follows the existing `migrate_019_*` idempotent pattern. Next free migration number to be confirmed at implementation time by inspecting `db/migrations/`.

## Components

- **`poller/legacy_indexer.py`** (new module)
  - `index_library(library_path: str, db, copy_thumbnails: bool = True, limit: int | None = None) -> dict` (stats).
  - Opens `osxphotos.PhotosDB(library_path)`, iterates photos, builds a row per asset, upserts (idempotent on identity), and copies an existing derivative/preview thumbnail into BP's thumb cache (no regeneration). Uses `poller/bp_logging.py`.
- **`db/db.py`**: `upsert_legacy_asset(...)`, `legacy_asset_count()`, `iter_legacy_assets()`.
- **CLI (`bp`)**: `bp index-legacy --library <path> [--no-thumbnails] [--limit N]`. Path from `--library`, falling back to optional `legacy_library.path` in config; the flag always wins. Identity is path-independent, so re-pointing requires no reindex.
- **Matching preview (`bp match-legacy-preview`)**: joins `legacy_assets` to Flickr-only `candidate_public` photos. Match key is `date_taken`, with dimensions and title as disambiguators. Emits a tiered report (confident / ambiguous / no-match) and optional CSV. **Writes nothing to `photos`.**

Matching feasibility (verified against the live DB): Flickr-only `candidate_public` rows have `date_taken` 100% (34035/34035), dimensions ~100% (34034), `flickr_title` 72% (24555). The legacy assets carry all of these plus fingerprint.

## Data flow

```
mount (AFP/SMB/HDD)
   └─ bp index-legacy --library <path>
        └─ osxphotos reads metadata + copies thumbnails
             └─ legacy_assets rows in curator.db

bp match-legacy-preview
   └─ reads legacy_assets + photos → tiered match report (no writes)
```

The live review queue and `photos` table are never modified by either command.

## Error handling & safety

- **Read-only on the library bundle**: we only read it (osxphotos copies the DB to a temp dir on open); thumbnails are copied *out*. The bundle is never written.
- Missing / unmounted library path → clear error message, non-zero exit.
- Idempotent re-runs: upsert by `(library_uuid, asset_uuid)`; already-cached thumbnails are skipped. `--limit` enables quick test runs over slow AFP/SMB links.
- **osxphotos open — verified:** a feasibility open-test confirmed `osxphotos.PhotosDB` opens this Photos 4 library successfully (237,309 photos, persons present), in ~243 s over AFP (hence the optional local DB cache above). Remaining contingency: if osxphotos later proves unreliable on this library, fall back to a **direct read-only SQL reader** against `Photos.sqlite` (`ZGENERICASSET ⋈ ZPERSON ⋈ ZDETECTEDFACE`) behind the same `index_library` interface — the data model, CLI, and matching preview are unaffected.

## Testing (TDD)

- **Migration test**: table + columns exist; idempotent re-run (mirrors `migrate_019` tests).
- **DB methods**: `upsert_legacy_asset` insert + update; idempotency on duplicate identity.
- **Indexer unit test**: mock `osxphotos.PhotosDB` with fake photo objects → assert rows built correctly (persons, face counts, bundle-relative paths) and thumbnail-copy invoked. No real 1.8 GB read in CI.
- **Matching-preview test**: seed `legacy_assets` + Flickr-only `candidate_public` photos with overlapping date/dimensions → assert the report identifies the match and asserts **zero writes** to `photos`.
- **Path-independence test**: re-index the same identity from a different `library_path` → updates the same row, no duplicate.

Run `python -m pytest tests/ -q` and `make lint` (mypy-clean, no bare `# type: ignore`).

## Release

Branch + green PR (no direct commits to `main`). Reference **#162** in commits; relates to **#12**. Version bump to **1.4.0** on merge (via branch + PR per branch-protection policy). Add the `has-plan` label to #162 once the implementation plan is written.
