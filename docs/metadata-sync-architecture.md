# Metadata Sync Architecture

**Goal:** Make the local SQLite database a cache of "last known state" for both Flickr and Apple Photos metadata (title, description, tags). Once both sides are in the DB, a lightweight sync engine can detect changes, generate reviewable proposals, and push confirmed values to either side — without hitting the Flickr API per-photo on every run.

**Ultimate vision:** An eventually-consistent bridge. When metadata changes on Flickr or in Apple Photos, the other side reflects it within a configurable window (hours to days via scheduled jobs), with manual conflict resolution for cases where both sides changed independently.

**Implementation order:** Start with tags only. Tags are the highest-volume field; getting tag sync right validates the whole proposal/apply pipeline. Expand to title and description once the pipeline is proven.

---

## Design principles

Non-negotiable constraints that shape every implementation decision:

1. **No silent writes.** Nothing changes on either Flickr or Apple Photos without an explicit, logged operation. Background jobs detect and cache; they do not write.
2. **Explicit state only.** The DB reflects confirmed state. A field is only marked "applied" after the write is confirmed, not when it is queued.
3. **Proposals, not direct writes.** The sync engine produces proposals (`pending` records in `metadata_proposals`). Proposals are reviewed and applied separately. No change bypasses the proposal lifecycle.
4. **Manual conflict resolution.** When both sides have changed independently, the system surfaces the conflict for human decision; it never auto-resolves.
5. **Idempotent operations.** Applying the same proposal twice does nothing. Rejecting a proposal suppresses it until state genuinely changes.
6. **Separate validation from mutation.** `bp reconcile` (validate mode) detects mismatches. `bp reconcile --fix` (harmonize mode) applies confirmed proposals. Keep them separate.
7. **Verify after Photos writes.** Apple Photos APIs are less reliable than Flickr's. After writing via photoscript, re-read the value to confirm it was applied. Mark as applied only on confirmed success.

## Field authority matrix

| Field | Authority | Default direction | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| `tags` | Merged / manual | Both sides contribute; conflicts reviewed | Highest priority; implement first |
| `title` | Neither (manual) | Conflict → review queue | Either side may have been edited by the user |
| `description` | Neither (manual) | Conflict → review queue | Either side may have been edited by the user |
| `date_taken` | Apple Photos (EXIF) | Photos → Flickr | EXIF is ground truth; Flickr's copy should match |
| `permissions` | DB / policy | DB → Flickr | Existing review → reconcile flow; unchanged |
| `albums` | Flickr (primary) | Flickr → Photos (read-only reflection) | Handled separately; see `docs/album-metadata-sync.md` |

*"Neither (manual)"* means: if both sides are non-empty and different, the system records a conflict and waits for a human decision.

---

## Change detection semantics

Precise per-field rules prevent unnecessary churn and noisy proposals.

### Tags
Compare as **normalized sets** (see tag normalization below). Two tag sets are considered equal if their normalized forms are identical sets.

- Tag order change only → **no change**
- Case change only (e.g. `Nature` → `nature`) → **no change** (normalized away)
- Whitespace-only difference → **no change** (normalized away)
- Tags added on one side → **non-conflict proposal** (see conflict classification)
- Tags removed on one side → **divergence** (requires review)
- Tags completely different → **collision** (requires review)

### Title
Compare after trimming leading/trailing whitespace. Any remaining difference is a detected change. Case-only changes are **not** normalized away for titles (a user may have intentionally changed `"my photo"` to `"My Photo"`).

### Description
Compare after trimming leading/trailing whitespace. Any remaining difference is a detected change.

---

## Tag normalization

Canonical form applied before all comparisons and before storing to DB:

1. **Trim** leading and trailing whitespace.
2. **Lowercase** (Unicode-aware: `"Ñoño".lower()`).
3. **NFC normalize** (Python: `unicodedata.normalize("NFC", tag)`).
4. **Deduplicate** within a set (case-insensitive exact matches only; near-synonyms are not merged).
5. **No delimiter splitting** — tags are stored as discrete items; commas or spaces within a tag string are preserved as part of the tag (Flickr and Photos both use discrete tag objects, not delimiter-separated strings in their APIs).

Original casing from the source is preserved in storage (`flickr_tags`, `photos_tags`). Normalization is applied only for comparison, and to the `canonical_tags` column when writing the resolved value.

**Tag hash:** Store `flickr_tags_hash` and `photos_tags_hash` (SHA-256 of the sorted normalized tag set, as a hex string). The sync engine filters on `flickr_tags_hash != photos_tags_hash` before doing the full set comparison, avoiding per-photo JSON parsing at scale.

---

## Conflict classification

Three distinct categories, each with a defined action:

| Type | Definition | Example | Action |
|------|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Non-conflict** | One side has a value; the other is empty | Photos has no tags; Flickr has tags | Auto-generate proposal; no human review required |
| **Divergence** | Both sides have values; one side's value is a strict extension of the other (tags: one set is a superset) | Flickr has `[nature, landscape]`; Photos has `[nature]` | Generate proposal; recommend auto-apply but allow review |
| **Collision** | Both sides have values and neither is a superset of the other | Flickr title: `"Sunset"`, Photos title: `"Golden Hour"` | Generate conflict proposal; **requires human resolution** |

In the proposals table, `conflict_type` is always one of `non_conflict`, `divergence`, or `collision`. The UI surfaces collisions prominently; non-conflicts can be batch-approved.

**Divergence direction rule (tags):** When one tag set is a strict superset of the other, always propose syncing *upward* — adding the missing tags to the smaller side. Never propose removing tags from the larger side to match the smaller. Tag sets only grow through the sync engine; removal requires explicit human action outside this system. Concretely: if Flickr has `[nature, landscape, travel]` and Photos has `[nature]`, the proposal is "add `landscape` and `travel` to Photos", not "remove `landscape` and `travel` from Flickr".

**Hash collision risk:** SHA-256 collisions are astronomically unlikely but theoretically possible. The hash is a fast-path filter only — if hashes match, the system skips full comparison. In `--verbose` mode, a sample of "hash-equal" records can be spot-checked against the full JSON to verify. No special handling is required in normal operation.

---

## Proposals table

The central new DB table. The sync engine writes proposals here; the apply step reads from here. Nothing is written to either Flickr or Photos without a proposal record.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS metadata_proposals (
    id                      INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    photo_id                INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES photos(id),
    field                   TEXT NOT NULL,   -- 'title', 'description', 'tags'
    proposed_value          TEXT,            -- serialized (JSON for tags, plain text for others)
    source                  TEXT NOT NULL,   -- 'flickr' | 'photos' | 'manual'
    target                  TEXT NOT NULL,   -- 'flickr' | 'photos'
    conflict_type           TEXT NOT NULL,   -- 'non_conflict' | 'divergence' | 'collision'
    source_hash_at_creation TEXT,            -- hash of source field when proposal was created
    target_hash_at_creation TEXT,            -- hash of target field when proposal was created
    status                  TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
                                             -- 'pending' | 'applied' | 'rejected' | 'superseded'
    created_at              TEXT NOT NULL,   -- ISO8601
    resolved_at             TEXT,            -- ISO8601; set when status leaves 'pending'
    resolution_note         TEXT             -- optional human note
);
```

**Proposal identity key:** `(photo_id, field, proposed_value, target, source)`. All five must match for two proposals to be considered duplicates. Including `source` prevents ambiguity if the same value is independently proposed from both sides.

**Idempotency and lifecycle rules:**

1. **Deduplication:** Before inserting, check for an existing `pending` proposal with the same identity key. If found, skip the insert.

2. **Staleness / supersession:** A proposal is stale when `source_hash_at_creation != current_source_hash` for that field. On this condition, mark the existing `pending` proposal `superseded` and generate a fresh one. Use hashes, not timestamps — timestamp changes (e.g. a re-fetch that returns the same value) must not trigger supersession.

3. **Rejection persistence:** A `rejected` proposal is not regenerated unless the source hash changes. The sync engine checks: if a `rejected` proposal exists for `(photo_id, field)` and `source_hash_at_creation == current_source_hash`, skip proposal generation entirely.

4. **Apply-time staleness re-check (required):** At the moment of applying a proposal, re-check `current_source_hash == proposal.source_hash_at_creation`. If they differ, refuse to apply and mark the proposal `superseded`. Do not rely solely on the proposal-generation check — the source may have changed between generation and apply.

5. **Apply-time target drift check (required):** Also at apply time, re-check `current_target_hash == proposal.target_hash_at_creation`. If they differ, the target has been independently edited since the proposal was created. Mark the proposal `superseded` and re-run the sync engine for that photo (it will reclassify, likely as a collision). This prevents silently overwriting newer user edits on the target side.

6. **No retroactive proposals on first migration:** When the schema migration runs, set `meta_last_harmonized_at = NOW()` for all existing rows. The sync engine treats this as "assumed in sync at migration time" — it is not a verified sync state, but it suppresses the initial noise burst. Future changes will generate proposals organically. Document this clearly in the migration script.

7. **Proposal table pruning:** Applied, rejected, and superseded proposals accumulate indefinitely. A periodic `bp db prune-proposals --older-than 90d` command (or equivalent) will eventually be needed. Not required now.

**UX / workflow:**
- The reviewer UI `/proposals` page (new) lists pending proposals grouped by conflict type.
- **Non-conflicts** can be bulk-approved ("apply all tag additions to Photos").
- **Divergences** are listed with recommended action pre-selected; one click to confirm.
- **Collisions** require explicit side-selection per field.
- Proposals share a grouping key of `(field, target)` for batch operations — e.g. "apply all pending tag additions to Photos" in one action.
- CLI: `bp sync-metadata --list-proposals` prints pending proposals in tabular form for headless review.

---

## Drift detection

A photo is considered **in sync** when:

```
meta_last_harmonized_at >= max(flickr_last_updated, meta_synced_photos_at)
```

If `flickr_last_updated` advances (a new Flickr poll fetched a newer `lastupdate`), the photo needs re-harmonization. If `meta_synced_photos_at` advances (Photos was re-scanned), same. The sync engine processes only photos where this condition is false — avoiding redundant work on every run.

---

## Change tracking columns

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `meta_synced_flickr_at` | When we last successfully fetched Flickr metadata |
| `flickr_last_updated` | `lastupdate` from Flickr API — when Flickr last modified this photo |
| `meta_synced_photos_at` | When we last successfully read Photos metadata |
| `meta_last_harmonized_at` | When the sync engine last processed this photo |
| `flickr_tags_hash` | SHA-256 of sorted normalized Flickr tag set |
| `photos_tags_hash` | SHA-256 of sorted normalized Photos tag set |

---

## Current state (before this work)

- `bp sync-metadata` fetches title/description/tags from Flickr **live** for every photo on every run (~18 hours for 71k photos).
- The poller fetches Flickr title/description/tags but discards them before writing to the DB (`poller.py` lines 425–432).
- Apple Photos metadata is read live via osxphotos during sync, not cached.
- The DB has no stored representation of either side's current metadata state.
- Conflicts are detected and stored in `metadata_conflicts` but only relative to the live values at the time of the run, with no proposal lifecycle.

---

## Target state

```
Flickr API  ──poll──►  flickr_title / flickr_description / flickr_tags / flickr_tags_hash
                                        │
                                  sync engine (per-field, drift-filtered)
                                  generates metadata_proposals
                                        │
Apple Photos ──scan──► photos_title / photos_description / photos_tags / photos_tags_hash
```

The sync engine runs the drift filter, classifies each out-of-sync field, and writes proposals. The reviewer UI and/or `bp reconcile --fix` applies confirmed proposals. No API calls during sync once the cache is warm.

---

## Phases

### Phase 1 — DB schema: cache both sides ✓ done
*Prerequisite for everything else. Safe to ship alone.*

Add columns to the `photos` table and create the `metadata_proposals` table:

**`photos` table additions:**

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `flickr_title` | TEXT | Last title fetched from Flickr |
| `flickr_description` | TEXT | Last description fetched from Flickr |
| `flickr_tags` | TEXT | JSON array — last tags fetched from Flickr (original casing) |
| `flickr_tags_hash` | TEXT | SHA-256 of sorted normalized Flickr tag set |
| `flickr_last_updated` | TEXT | ISO8601 — Flickr's `lastupdate` for this photo |
| `photos_title` | TEXT | Last title read from Apple Photos |
| `photos_description` | TEXT | Last description read from Apple Photos |
| `photos_tags` | TEXT | JSON array — last keywords read from Apple Photos (original casing) |
| `photos_tags_hash` | TEXT | SHA-256 of sorted normalized Photos tag set |
| `meta_synced_flickr_at` | TEXT | ISO8601 — when we last fetched from Flickr |
| `meta_synced_photos_at` | TEXT | ISO8601 — when we last read from Photos |
| `meta_last_harmonized_at` | TEXT | ISO8601 — when sync engine last ran for this photo |
| `tags_truncated_for_flickr` | INTEGER | Boolean — canonical tags exceeded 75 on last push |

**New `metadata_proposals` table:** as defined in the proposals section above.

**Files to change:**
- `db/schema.sql`
- `db/migrations/migrate_008_metadata_cache.py`

**Completion criteria:** columns and table exist; no behaviour changes yet.

---

### Phase 2 — Poller writes Flickr metadata to DB ✓ done
*Depends on Phase 1.*

Stop discarding `flickr_title`, `flickr_description`, `flickr_tags` in `poller.py`. Write them into the new columns. Capture `lastupdate` into `flickr_last_updated`. Compute and store `flickr_tags_hash`. Set `meta_synced_flickr_at`.

**Incremental refresh (nice-to-have):** `bp poll --sort updated` fetches photos sorted by `date-updated` descending, enabling a daily job to skip unchanged photos. Not required for Phase 2 completion.

**Files to change:**
- `poller/poller.py`

**Completion criteria:** after `bp poll --backfill`, `flickr_tags`/`flickr_tags_hash`/`flickr_last_updated` populated for all photos with `flickr_id`.

---

### Phase 3 — Scanner writes Photos metadata to DB ✓ done
*Depends on Phase 1. Independent of Phase 2.*

Add a Photos metadata pass to `bp scan` that reads title, description, and keywords from the Photos library for every photo with a `uuid`. Compute and store `photos_tags_hash`. Set `meta_synced_photos_at`. Detect changes by comparing incoming values against stored `photos_*` columns; log differences.

**Files to change:**
- `poller/scanner.py` (or new `poller/metadata_scanner.py`)
- `bp` if a new sub-command

**Completion criteria:** after `bp scan`, `photos_tags`/`photos_tags_hash` populated for all photos with `uuid`.

---

### Phase 4 — Sync engine: diff and generate proposals (tags first) ✓ done
*Depends on Phases 1–3. Tags only in this phase.*

`bp sync-metadata` runs the drift filter, compares tag hashes, classifies
divergences, and writes to `metadata_proposals`. No API calls. 70,946 photos
processed in ~2.5 s; 60,220 hash matches (already in sync), ~11,226 proposals.

- **Drift filter:** selects photos where both caches populated and
  `meta_last_harmonized_at < MAX(COALESCE(flickr_last_updated, meta_synced_flickr_at), meta_synced_photos_at)` (or NULL).
- **Fast path:** hash match → set `meta_last_harmonized_at`, skip.
- **Classification:** non_conflict / divergence / collision per architecture rules.
- **Idempotency:** pending dup → skip; stale hash → supersede + new; rejected same hash → skip.
- **`--refresh-flickr`:** re-fetches Flickr cache via API before syncing (opt-in).
- Batch commits every 500 photos.

**Files to change:**
- `flickr/metadata_puller.py`
- `flickr/sync_metadata.py`

**Completion criteria:** `bp sync-metadata` with warm cache completes in under 60 seconds for 71k photos; proposals appear in `metadata_proposals`.

---

### Phase 5 — Proposal review UI and apply step (tags) ✓ done
*Depends on Phase 4.*

`/proposals` page in the reviewer UI groups by conflict type (collisions first, then
divergences, then non-conflicts). 11,226 proposals generated on first run across 70,946
photos (10,226 non-conflicts, 1,000 collisions, 0 divergences).

- **Non-conflicts:** bulk-approve button applies all in one step.
- **Divergences:** single Approve/Reject per card.
- **Collisions:** "Use Flickr" / "Use Photos" buttons per card; approving either side
  auto-rejects the sibling proposal. Collision pairs are deduplicated in the display
  (only flickr→photos direction shown; photos→flickr sibling resolved automatically).
- **Keyboard shortcuts:** `p` = approve / use Photos, `f` = use Flickr (collisions only),
  `x` = reject / skip, `j`/`k` = navigate.
- `bp reconcile --apply-proposals` applies pending non-conflict proposals from the CLI.
- `flickr/proposal_applier.py`: apply-time staleness and target-drift re-checks, photoscript
  verify-after-write, 75-tag truncation for Flickr target.

**Files changed:**
- `flickr/proposal_applier.py` (new)
- `reviewer/app.py` + `reviewer/templates/proposals.html` (new)
- `poller/reconcile.py`

---

### Phase 6 — Manual merge editor for collision resolution
*Depends on Phase 5.*

Collisions currently require picking one side wholesale ("Use Flickr" or "Use Photos").
This phase adds an inline merge editor so users can construct a custom tag set from
elements of both sides — or add entirely new tags — without accepting either side entirely.

**UI on the `/proposals` page, collision cards only:**
- Expand/collapse inline editor triggered by an **Edit ✎** button (or `m` keyboard shortcut).
- Both tag sets rendered as toggleable chips: checked = include in merged result.
- All tags from both sides pre-checked by default; user unchecks to exclude.
- Free-text input to add new tags not present on either side.
- "Apply merged →" button sends the custom value to both Flickr and Photos simultaneously.
- Merged result stored with `source = 'manual'` in `metadata_proposals` (already supported
  by the schema).

**Backend:**
- New endpoint `POST /api/proposals/<id>/apply-manual` accepting `{"value": [...tags...]}`.
- Applies the custom tag list to both targets; marks proposal `applied` and
  auto-rejects the collision sibling.
- Same staleness and drift re-checks as the regular apply path.

**Keyboard shortcut:** `m` on a selected collision card opens the inline editor.
Non-collision cards ignore `m`.

**Files to change:**
- `reviewer/app.py`
- `reviewer/templates/proposals.html`
- `flickr/proposal_applier.py` (extend to accept an explicit value override)

**Completion criteria:** user can resolve any tag collision without accepting either side
wholesale; merged result is applied to both Flickr and Photos in a single action.

---

### Phase 7 — Expand to title and description
*Depends on Phase 5. Same pipeline, new fields.*

Extend Phases 2–5 to cover `flickr_title`/`photos_title` and `flickr_description`/`photos_description`. These fields have no hash optimization needed (short strings). Collision handling in the UI becomes the main addition.

**Add `canonical_*` columns here** (not before):
- `canonical_title`, `canonical_description`, `canonical_tags` — the resolved value after a collision is manually resolved.
- `canonical_pushed_to_flickr_at`, `canonical_pushed_to_photos_at` — per-field push confirmation timestamps.

**Files to change:**
- `db/schema.sql` + `db/migrations/migrate_010_canonical_metadata.py`
- All files touched in Phases 2–5, extended for title/description

---

### Phase 8 — Scheduled sync (cron / launchd)
*Depends on Phases 2–5.*

Add a `bp cron` command or `launchd` plist that schedules:
- `bp poll` — daily (refreshes Flickr cache)
- `bp scan` — weekly (refreshes Photos cache)
- `bp sync-metadata` — after each poll (fast drift detection, generates proposals)
- `bp reconcile --fix` — after sync-metadata (applies non-conflict proposals automatically; leaves collisions for the UI)

Reviewer dashboard: show "Flickr cache: N hours old" and "Photos cache: N hours old".

**Files to change:**
- `bp cron` sub-command or `launchd/com.bluepearmain.sync.plist`
- `reviewer/app.py` + `reviewer/templates/dashboard.html`

---

## Data flow summary

```
bp poll (daily)
  └─► flickr_tags, flickr_tags_hash, flickr_last_updated, meta_synced_flickr_at

bp scan (weekly)
  └─► photos_tags, photos_tags_hash, meta_synced_photos_at

bp sync-metadata (after poll — reads DB only, no API calls)
  ├─► drift filter: photos where harmonized < max(flickr_last_updated, photos_synced)
  ├─► hash comparison → skip unchanged photos
  ├─► full set diff → classify non_conflict / divergence / collision
  ├─► write metadata_proposals (deduplicated)
  └─► set meta_last_harmonized_at

/proposals UI (human, on demand)
  ├─► bulk-approve non-conflicts
  ├─► confirm divergences
  ├─► pick a side for collisions (Use Flickr / Use Photos)
  └─► manual merge editor for collisions (Phase 6) — custom tag set → both targets

bp reconcile --fix (after sync-metadata)
  ├─► apply approved proposals → Flickr (tags ≤75) → mark applied on confirmed success
  └─► apply approved proposals → Photos (via photoscript, verify after write)
```

---

## What is NOT in scope

- Real-time change detection (webhooks, file-system watchers). Everything is pull-based on a schedule.
- Auto-resolution of collisions. All ambiguous cases go to the review queue.
- Album sync (handled separately; see `docs/album-metadata-sync.md`).
- Privacy/visibility changes (handled by the existing review → reconcile flow).
- Tag synonym merging or semantic deduplication.

---

## Migration numbering

- `migrate_001` through `migrate_007` — pre-existing
- `migrate_008_metadata_cache.py` — Phase 1 (`flickr_*`/`photos_*` columns, `metadata_proposals` table) ✓
- `migrate_009_review_queue_index.py` — performance: covering index on `photos(privacy_state, date_taken DESC, id DESC)` ✓
- `migrate_010_canonical_metadata.py` — Phase 7 (`canonical_*` columns, push-tracking timestamps)
